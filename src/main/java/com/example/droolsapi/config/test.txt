1. Reflecting on the goals you had for this year, what were your key accomplishments?
After joining the team in June, I immediately began contributing to the CARE team and quickly ramped up on ongoing initiatives. I performed an end-to-end analysis of the Drools engine developed by the OAS team and documented the findings, which played a key role in guiding our architectural and design decisions.
A major accomplishment was optimizing rules execution on Snowflake — reducing execution time from 40–50 minutes to under 3 minutes through database optimizations and multithreaded execution.
I also developed a full-stack monolithic application using NetraAI (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), which was later demoed to leadership and received appreciation from Saurabh.
Additionally, I explored executing Drools in Databricks as well as rule execution without Drools using PySpark, opening new avenues for performance improvement.
Beyond development, I also collaborated with the A team to quickly gain knowledge on Kafka microservices, contributed to resolving issues, and mentored new joiners by sharing technical and functional knowledge across both CARE and A teams.

2. What challenges did you face and how did you develop?
One of the key challenges was understanding and optimizing the complex Drools + Snowflake execution framework, which required deep dives into both the codebase and data processing workflows. Through this, I enhanced my skills in performance tuning, parallel processing, and distributed data systems.
Another challenge was transitioning into new technologies and teams simultaneously, but by proactively collaborating with cross-functional teams and self-learning, I was able to gain expertise in Kafka, Databricks, and FastAPI in a short time.
These experiences improved my problem-solving ability, technical adaptability, and end-to-end ownership in delivering high-impact solutions.

3. What do you want to continue to work towards in the coming year?
In the coming year, I aim to:


Strengthen the Databricks-based execution framework to support large-scale, high-performance rule processing.


Contribute to modernization efforts by enhancing automation, monitoring, and observability within our data pipelines and rule engines.


Explore AI/ML integration for intelligent decisioning within our rule execution framework.


Continue to mentor new team members and enhance collaboration across teams to accelerate delivery.


Grow towards a tech lead role, focusing on architectural design and system scalability.



Would you like me to make it slightly more concise and formal (for official HR portal submission) or keep it as is (detailed and narrative)?
